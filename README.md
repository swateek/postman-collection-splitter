# POSTMAN Collection Splitter
There has been multiple times when POSTMAN fails to upload an already exported collection back into their app. This utility will help split the collection into smaller chunks and ensure a smooth import.

## Setting up the Project

```bash
python3 -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate
python3 app.py

```
